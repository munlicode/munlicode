I believe there is more to software than meets the eye. I love developing, and I take a lot of time to think on why and how I design. I love thinking about life and ideas, and knowledge in software makes my thoughts cleaner.


If you have an interest you can check out my developer webpage on https://munlicode.kreoza.com and personal webpage on https://nurzhanmuratkhan.kreoza.com. (p.s.: I try to keep them up-to-date, but it does not always workout, so I work on something to simplify of all that.)

<p>I am a water.</p>
<p>I consume, I create, I deliver, I relax and much more...</p>
