### 🧠 The Philosophy

I believe there is more to software than meets the eye. I love developing, and I take a lot of time to think on why and how I design. I love thinking about life and ideas, and knowledge in software makes my thoughts cleaner.

### 🔁 Life ⇄ Software

> "Once, there was a developer who believed in the **'Hero Model.'** He would clean every dish in the shared kitchen, fix every minor bug, and carry every burden. He felt indispensable... until he caught a fever."

### 🤝 Let's Build Meaningful Things

> "The best way to predict the future is to create it."

I'm always open to collaborating on projects that simplify life, solve real problems, or just bring joy. Whether it's a small tool or a grand idea, if it's built with purpose, I'm interested.

**Want to build something?** Opening an issue or a PR is the best way to start a conversation.

### ☕ Digital Coffee & Philosophy

Code is just one way I express my thoughts. I love talking about philosophy, life design, and the "why" behind what we build.

- **Want to talk tech?** Let's discuss architecture and clean code.
- **Want to talk life?** Let's discuss happiness and the pursuit of meaning.
- **Just want to say hi?** I'm always down for a virtual coffee, though I mostly drink water.
